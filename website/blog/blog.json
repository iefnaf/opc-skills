      "faq": [
        {
          "question": "What is Ralph AI and how does it work?",
          "answer": "Ralph is an autonomous AI agent loop that runs coding tools (Amp or Claude Code) repeatedly until all PRD items are complete. Each iteration spawns a fresh AI instance that picks the highest priority incomplete task, implements it, runs tests, and commits. Memory persists via git history, progress.txt, and prd.json."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can solopreneurs build MVPs with Ralph without coding experience?",
          "answer": "Yes. Ralph requires a PRD which you can create by describing your idea in plain English. Ralph handles all coding automatically. You need basic command line knowledge but no programming skills required."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long does Ralph take to build an MVP?",
          "answer": "Based on our case study, Ralph built a complete SaaS dashboard with authentication in 24 hours (15 user stories, 47 commits, 28 passing tests). Typical MVPs take 24-72 hours of autonomous development."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which AI coding tools does Ralph support?",
          "answer": "Ralph natively supports Amp CLI (default) and Claude Code. Use ./ralph.sh for Amp or ./ralph.sh --tool claude for Claude Code."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does Ralph integrate with OPC Skills?",
          "answer": "Install OPC skills globally (npx skills add ReScienceLab/opc-skills) and Ralph's AI instances automatically have access during the loop. Your PRD can reference skills like domain-hunter or logo-creator, and Ralph invokes them as needed."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is prd.json and how do I create it?",
          "answer": "prd.json is a JSON file containing user stories with pass/fail status. Create it using the ralph skill: (1) Write PRD in markdown, (2) Run 'Load ralph skill and convert prd.md to prd.json'."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does Ralph work for frontend/UI development?",
          "answer": "Yes. Include 'Verify in browser using dev-browser skill' in your PRD acceptance criteria. Ralph will navigate to pages, interact with UI, and take screenshots to verify implementation."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much does it cost to run Ralph?",
          "answer": "Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5): $30-60 for typical MVP. Amp pricing varies. Ralph is often cheaper than manual coding because fresh context reduces retries and errors."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is Ralph production-ready for startups?",
          "answer": "Yes, with caveats. Ralph requires strong feedback loops (tests, type checking) and well-structured PRDs. Best for solopreneurs who can review code before deployment. 7.9k GitHub stars indicate active community usage."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the prerequisites to run Ralph?",
          "answer": "You need: (1) Amp CLI or Claude Code installed, (2) jq command (brew install jq), (3) Git repository, (4) Basic understanding of your tech stack to write meaningful PRD items."
